# Lab 3 Answers

## Part 1: Git

### 1.1. List the contents of the lab03-exercises repo immediately after initialization

```
answers.md  README.md


```

### 1.2. Paste the output of your `git status` command

```

On branch my_lab3_work
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

```

### 1.3. Paste the output of the state of your repository after committing your README.md file

```
[my_lab3_work 03ed698] add README.md to the repository
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 lab03/README.md


```

### 1.4. Copy your `git log` output

```

### 1.5. Copy your `git diff` output

```
# paste code here

```

### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

- git init - makke the file system for git
- git status - tells you the current info on the git repo
- git add - adds new or updated files to working directory
- git commit - finalizes the changes to be made
- git log - log of all updates to branch
- git diff - shows the changes between updated files

### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)

Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)

Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem

Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.

### 3.2. Link to Repo

Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
# paste your new repo link here...

```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean?

create merge commit - all history and commits from current branch will be added to base branch

squash and merge - combine a series of commits from current branch into 1 and then add to the base branch

rebase and merge - the commits from the curret branch will be places on top of the last commit on the base branch
